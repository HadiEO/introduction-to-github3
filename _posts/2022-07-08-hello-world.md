This is a stream-of-consciousness talking. Man I'd love to blog about my 20s I spent on academic training to become a remote sensing scientists, experience in academia, 
international research organization, NGO, industry... 
the physics, then statistical/machine learning, then the large-scale mapping, the human side of things i.e. the labelling, 
challenges working in a developing country, multi-organizations colab, incentives alignment, the politics (certainly a lesson)...
and now a new journey to master the computational aspect of the domain, working in teams, to deploy real-world production-ready solutions.. finger-crossed!
